 -- Matthias Urlichs <smurf@noris.de>  17 Apr 2003 20:23:45 +0200

festival (1.4.2-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU, to prevent removal from woody.
  * Made /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50festival.el a conffile. Closes: #132192
  * Fixed bashisms in rules file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Mar 2002 18:57:33 -0500

festival (1.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pre-emptively make Festival *not* default to ESD audio, because it
    doesn't currently work.
  * Clean up some cruft from the init.scm that was there to work
    around bugs in 1.4.1.
  * Twiddle the XML stuff a bit more.  It still
    doesn't work perfectly since you need to (require 'sable-mode) (or
    have tts_file do it for you) before you can synth sable markup, but
    it's better than it used to be, at least.
  * Add SHELL definition to debian/rules since it contains bashisms.

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Aug 2001 12:33:25 -0400

festival (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Add Build-Depends: debhelper (strange this hasn't been reported yet)
  * Fix prerm to remove sgml catalog entry on removal (closes: #96714)
  * Twiddle paths in sable-mode to make it DTRT (closes: #106190)

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Aug 2001 22:28:51 -0400

festival (1.4.1p-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sorry ... have to rebuild this to get the correct speech-tools
    dependency.
  * Tweak the configuration stuff slightly.
  * Add Build-Depends: texinfo (closes: #93147)

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Apr 2001 15:27:15 -0400

festival (1.4.1p-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer using DBS.  Because I can't overwrite the .orig.tar.gz, I've
    added a 'p' (for 'pristine', I guess) to the version number.
    Wish our source package format wasn't so @#$%# broken... sigh...
  * Twiddled configuration to build on all systems (it will fall back to
    something reasonable, and it recognizes Debian specifically now)
  * Fix brokenness in postinst/postrm (which should actually be prerm).
    (closes: #91222)
  * Make 16-bit audio the default.  I think it's safe to say that 16-bit
    sound cards are now the vast majority.
  * Remove NAS support, which is no longer in speech_tools either.
  * Add an init script for optionally starting a festival server at boot
    time.  This is turned off by default for security reasons.
  * Apply serverdiphfdfix.patch from
    http://festvox.org/packed/festival/1.4.1/PATCHES, merge changes from
    lexicon.cc, siteinit.scm.

festival (1.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use -l option to dh_shlibdeps.  Closes: #50602, #50600
  * Applied patch to sys-build.mak from Adam Heath.  Closes: #50327
  * Created a sparc_Linux2.2.mak.  Closes: #50472

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Nov 1999 13:57:01 -0500

festival (1.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turns out the authors forgot to include a generic configuration file
    for Linux 2.2 on i386.
  * Fixed a foible in debian/rules that caused the *.so links to be
    created in the wrong package, yuck.

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Nov 1999 23:35:27 -0500

festival (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  Is now free software.  Hooray.
  * Change in source format - festival and speech-tools now build from a
    single source package again, using Adam Heath's most excellent build
    system.  This allows me to eliminate many (but not all) of the nasty
    hacks previously needed to build this package.  An unfortunate side
    effect of this is that the version number of the debian package for
    speech-tools does not reflect the actual upstream numbering system.
    This is due to Festival and Speech-Tools having a build system that is
    designed with the intent that the packages will be built under the
    same directory together and installed in place.  As the authors state,
    this reflects the purpose of Festival as a research system.  It does,
    however, make life very difficult when trying to produce a
    distributable and policy-compliant Debian package.
  * Most of the documentation is in the festival-doc package now.  This is
    from the prebuilt festdoc package provided upstream, as it appears to
    be quite impossible to build the docs without a specially modified
    version of doc++ (boooooo)

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Nov 1999 20:05:18 -0500

festival (1.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now installs festival.el properly.  Also, did s/stml/sable/g.  Run
    "say-minor-mode" to get a nice menu for reading your buffers.
  * Also builds info documentation (this creates a rather nasty source
    dependency on the voice packages, which I'll try to fix ASAP)
  * Also builds C++ API documentation in HTML.
  * Renamed ppc_Linux.mak to powerpc_Linux.mak (doh!)
  * Work around some RXP weirdness with respect to the location of the
    Sable DTD.  (a real fix will have to wait until a standalone RXP is
    packaged and we can link against it)

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Fri, 28 May 1999 00:15:49 -0400

festival (1.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned out the Debian diff a bit
  * Added some .mak files that may or may not allow the package to
    build on non-i386 platforms.
  * Installing the Sable DTD with sgml-base now, so that it works
    automagically with Emacs, nsgmls, and the like.

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Tue,  4 May 1999 18:40:00 -0400

festival (1.3.1-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed it to compile with glibc 2.1.

festival (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated copyright file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 26 Aug 1998 15:57:21 -0700

festival (1.2.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

    audio. However, it will continue to use 8 bit audio by default.

  * New standards-version.
  * Rebuilt with debhlper 0.60 to fix many mode 444 and 555 files.
